💸 SplitApp – Group Expense Tracker & Split Manager
SplitApp is a full-stack expense splitting application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It simplifies managing shared expenses across groups like friends, roommates, office teams, or trips — eliminating the need for manual calculations and awkward money conversations.
